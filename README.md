# Outcomes based on Goal

Looking at Outcomes Based on Goal chart, we can see a flat zero line for Percentage of Canceled. That means that all projects performing plays are launched, and there were no plays canceled.
The smaller of the project’s goal is, the higher rate of successful it will get (from less than $1000 to $5000).
# Outcomes based on Launch Date

Theater projects looks more successful if they are launched in May and June. However, the failed rate is also higher than in these months. Projects are launched more in summer, and they yield higher rates of successful and failed relatively. Overall, nearly half of projects is failed. It cannot prove that if projects are more successful if launched in summer. Generally, the factor contribute to the successful rate is mostly by the setting goals, not by the launch dates.

The table analyzing Outcomes base on Goal does not include “live” outcomes. Therefore, the total number of plays would be off as well as the other outcomes percentages. “Live” outcome here does not have a big effect on the other percentages because it is not significant. What if it is significant, and “live” could be considered “successful’ if it is defined clearer, we would miss a big portion of data. It is also not a good practice because we cannot cross-check with total number or plays. For example, the sum of Total Projects column should be equal to the total of plays on Kickstarter. Once we get the analyzed numbers, we need to figure out some ways to cross check and be sure if our numbers tie with original numbers.
Moreover, the numbers of plays launched at different goal set are not consistent. For example, total projects with goal “less than 1000’ (186) is greater than projects with goal “35000 to 40000” (6). Goal “35000 to 40000” has high percentage of successful, but this number is not reflecting to true picture. The more of that goal is launched, the higher percentage of failed would be due to its higher goal amount.
